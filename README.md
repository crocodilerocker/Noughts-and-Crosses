# Noughts and Crosses
## Classic Game in HTML, CSS and JS

Followed YouTube instructional video from WebDevSimplified to create this, and added/changed a few elements myself, including:

+ Startup screen with title, text input and Play! button.
+ Scoreboard at top right corner
+ Resized the O mark to match X
+ Personalised winning message

In future, I would like to build on this project by implementing a minimax algorithm so the user can play against the computer.
